                <h2>Expectations</h2>
                <p>I expect for my classmate to cooperate in groupworks.
                    As a student I expect my classmate to follow the regulation, such
                    as no food in the lab room.
                    I also expect my instructor to be strict yet understandable to the students.
                    Focused on learning the skill than the theoretical learning.
                    Short fun activities to in between the to help understand more topic.</p>

                <h2>Motivations</h2>
                <p>The tuition fee pushes me to make it worth it and not waste it.
                    My parents who push me to do my best in understanding the lessons.
                    I don’t want to repeat the subject, I feel like I wasted the money.
                    On the brighter side, in the future if I do succeed, I there is a chance I get to travel around.</p>

                <h2>Contributions</h2>
                <p>As a student I should do my part such as cleaning and fixing my area as the class end.
                    I would also remind my classmate to do the same.
                    I will also lend my things to my classmate if they are in need.
                    If they don’t understand on what to do, I will also explain it to them.
                    I will cooperate in group activities and try to be more active in class</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Hindrances</h2>
                <p>I tend to day dream time to time, which I will be surprise what was the lesson about.
                    There’s also time understanding the activity that I need sample from my classmates.
                    Now that phones can be access during class, I can easily distract myself in the phone.
                    I always have problems when I speak, it’s either I speak to fast or I am mumbling/fumbling, people will
                    ask me a lot to repeat myself.
                    To be honest the influence of the people's lifestyle I'm with</p>
